This is the first project with TOP on how to set up a website. 
Will make loads of rubbish, but the point is to practice on the structure of a basic website.
I will demonstrate how to create a list of items, in an unordered way, containing other lists of items,
 with step-by-step instructions on how to make something.
Is it going to be italian food recipes? Not really.
Will use Microsoft Designer for images and structure of recipes.
Enjoy!
